# OOP-II-Project

COVID-19 19 ruined our medical system. But the truth is, it just visualizes the true scenario of our medical system. We cannotstop this by a day. But we can learn from this situation and prepare for the future. We can change our medical system and manage it by an app. We can make our whole medical system in a digital way. 

In this project, we try to implement an app that can manage the medical system, store the patient's past, and present data. Every patient, doctor, and pharmacy have their own profile and see their data. A proper way to distribute medicine for everyone.
